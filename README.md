# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game-with-Game-Record
The Tic Tac Toe Game with Game Record is a C++ program that allows two players to play the classic game of Tic Tac Toe. The program keeps track of the game's progress and records the game data, such as the winner, game duration, and the date and time of each game, in a file named "games.txt" on your desktop.

**Features:**

Player Names: The players are prompted to enter their names at the beginning of the game.

Game Progress: The program displays the Tic Tac Toe game board and prompts each player to make a move.

Game Recording: After the game is over (either won or drawn), the program records the game data, including the date, player names, winner (if applicable), game duration, active dates, and the number of games played, in the "games.txt" file.

Game Duration: The program calculates and displays the total duration of the game in seconds.

Draw Handling: If all the moves have been made, and no player has won, the program declares the game as a draw.
